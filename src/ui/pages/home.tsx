                          <p>Heavily under construction. Like the Alpha Strike Roster, this is a set of Electronic Record Sheets which will allow you to:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Track your movement modes and to-hit numbers for each mech at a glance</li>
                            <li>Set your targets speed, range, and other to-hit modifiers (you may have up to 3 targets at one time)</li>
                            <li>Assign your weapons to your targets, your GATOR and final To-Hit will be calculated for you</li>
                            <li>During the Firing Phase, you'll open up a single sheet with all your 'mechs and weapons with their respective targets with the ability to mark the attack as resolved. Cluster hits are easily tracked as well.</li>
                            <li>Heat is automatically assigned during the heat phase per the 'mech's movement mode and discharged weapons.</li>

                  <p>Each of these software packages are amazing tools! However what they lack is complete cross-platform compatibility and ease of tablet use. Sure, <a href="https://battletech.rpg.hu/mechfactory_frame.php">Mech Factory</a> comes close, but it can't be used offline.</p>
                  <p>Jeff created this app originally as an electronic Alpha Strike roster sheet, but it's grown into more.</p>

                      <p>Updated print mode to improve look and feel. Added mech tokens and ability cards.</p>
                      <p>Ability crits will now lower values of appropriate special weapon attacks. (LRM,SRM,IF,HT,ARTX,TUR,etc.)</p>
                      <p>Formations now require 3 units before they can be selected, per ASCE rules. This change aims to lower confusion about them for new players.</p>
                      <p>Added even more Forcepacks!</p>

                      <p>We've added the 3 formation bonuses from the Tukayyid campaign book: Phalanx Star, Rogue Star and Strategic Command Star. I'm convinced the last one only exists because of Phellan's Star Composition in the third Blood of Kerensky Book. We've also fixed a couple of bugs. Formation Bonuses will show up properly when you add a Force Pack to your force. Additionally, the Command Lance will show up along with all of the other formations for an empty lance.</p>
