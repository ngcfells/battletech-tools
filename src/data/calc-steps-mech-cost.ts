/**
 * 'Mech C-bill cost step definitions (#599): where each step of the calculation comes from.
 *
 * Every entry was read on the page it cites, on 2026-11-11; what each page says and how the code compares is in
 * docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-10-cited-bv-ledger.md. The cost follows the current rules (TechManual pp.274-285,
 * with Tactical Operations: Advanced Units & Equipment and Interstellar Operations: Alternate Eras for the gear they
 * add) under every rules edition. A component's price is `cited` only where its own table row was read: the
 * READ_ROWS lists below. Any other component reads the `.record` step, which says its price is from our records.
 * Change a citation only after reading the page.
