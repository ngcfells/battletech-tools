/**
 * Micro-Mech cost and Battle Value step definitions (#173, Custom Homebrew): where each step comes from.
 *
 * A Micro-Mech is fan-made. Its cost and Battle Value rules are the appendices of "Micro-Mechs" 6.1.0.2 (PDF pages
 * 11 and 12), which change rows of the BattleMech rules in the BattleTech Master Rules, Revised Edition: the cost
 * table on p.149 and the Battle Value procedure on pp.152-154. Both were read on 2026-11-13; the document's page
 * numbers fit the FanPro printing. The equipment figures are the document's own tables (PDF pages 7 to 11).
 *
 * `cited` here means the step follows the document or the Master Rules page as read. Every Battle Value is still
 * provisional as a whole: no official Battle Value exists for a fan-made unit (MicroMech.isBattleValueProvisional).
 * The BV2 table is ours (owner ruling 2, 2026-11-13): the document's changes run over the TechManual procedure. Each
 * of its steps is `provisional` and says what we did. Change a citation only after reading the page.
