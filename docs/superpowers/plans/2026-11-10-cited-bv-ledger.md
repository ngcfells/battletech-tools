# Cited Battle Value: reading ledger (#599)

What was read, where, and how our code compares. Everything here is in our own words; no rulebook text is copied.
The step ids are the keys of the definition tables in `src/data/calc-steps-mech-*.ts`.

How pages were read: the text extracts in `C:/repo/ResourceLibrary` (`library_search.py --page`), and the page image
(`render_page.py`, or a crop of it) wherever a table was involved or the extract ran columns together. "Image" in the
last column means the page image was checked.

The v4.1 Battle Value chapter was compared with TM pp.302-304 line by line for the 'Mech rules: the rules text is
the same. The IO:AE errata v3.01 has one Battle Value entry (Dead-Fire ammunition, p.190); it does not touch any
'Mech step below.

## Sources to ask the owner for

None for 'Mech BV2.

For BV1: Maximum Tech, first printing (FASA 1700, 1997). The library holds the corrected second printing (1999) and
the FanPro Revised (2005). Both print Inner Sphere Grenade Launcher BV 1; the owner recalls 15 in one printing.
Nothing waits on it.

## 'Mech BV1 (read 2026-11-10 and 2026-11-11)

Code: `_calcBattleValue1` in `src/classes/battlemech.ts`; `getBattleValue1Rater`, `getBattleValue1Ammo` and `MAX_TECH`
in `src/data/battle-value.ts`. The two Master Rules books print the same procedure; the table gives both pages
(BMR / BMR(R)). Page numbers are the printed ones. The Level 3 rows were read in both printings of Maximum Tech: the
FASA corrected second printing (`mt`, cited under master-rules; its p.90 says it builds on Master Rules pp.139-145)
and the FanPro Revised (`mt-revised`, cited under master-rules-revised). The two print these rules on the same pages
with the same figures; the item tables, the special ammunition table and the engine table were compared on the page
images of both.

## Findings

Differences between the page and our code, and places where the books disagree with themselves. Nothing here was
changed while reading. Each is decided in the queue (plan Task 11) or by the owner.

1. **Inner Sphere XL engine and CASE in an arm.** TM p.302 counts explosive ammunition in any location of a 'Mech
   with an Inner Sphere XL engine. Our code excuses an arm that has its own CASE. The code comment says this follows
   the MUL, SSW and MegaMek. By the page, such ammunition costs 15 a slot. Shown as `provisional`.
2. **Prototype CASE.** IO:AE p.189 (table, checked on the image): ammunition slots count 8, not 15. Our code treats
   prototype CASE as CASE, so those slots cost nothing. This looks like our bug. FIXED 2026-11-10: in BV2, an
   ammunition slot spared only by prototype CASE now costs 8 (step `bv2.def.explosive.prototype-case`); where CASE
   gives no relief (Inner Sphere XL side torso) it still costs 15. Explosive components behind it are unchanged.
3. **Dark Age armor multipliers.** IO:AE p.185 prints Anti-Penetrative Ablation 1.2, Heat-Dissipating 1.05,
   Impact-Resistant 1, Ballistic-Reinforced 1.2. IO:AE p.190 prints 1.2, 1.1, none, and 1.5. Errata v3.01 is silent.
   Our records use p.190's (heat-dissipating 1.1, ballistic-reinforced 1.5). A question for Catalyst; shown as
   `provisional`. DECIDED 2026-11-10 (owner): keep p.190. Interstellar Operations (2016; errata v1.1, v1.21 silent)
   prints 1.2 / 1.1 / 1 / 1.5 in both its tables, and IO:AE errata v3.01 is silent. Tried p.185 (1.05, 1.2): all
   30 bundled designs with these armors (26 'Mechs, 4 vehicles; MUL and SSW/MegaMek file BVs) then fell 10 to 276
   BV below the published figure, e.g. Hatamoto-Godai HTM-30Z 1,899 to 1,710, Spider VTOLAM 898 to 816. The
   published BVs compute with p.190. Stays `provisional`, as the book still prints both; the 2023 third printing
   (not held) may settle it.
4. **AES on a tripod's legs.** TO:AUE p.192 adds 10 percent of the tonnage for each limb with an AES. Our code adds
   20 percent for a full set of legs unless the 'Mech is a quad (40), so a tripod's three legs give 20, not 30.
   FIXED 2026-11-10: 10 percent for each leg, so a tripod's three give 30 (`getAESBVMultiplier`).
5. **An armored gyro.** TO:AUE p.192 gives 5 points a slot for an item with no BV. Our code uses 5 percent of the
   gyro points for each slot; the comment says this follows MegaMek and SSW. Shown as `provisional`.
6. **UMU and the jump bonus.** TO:AUE p.192 says to calculate a UMU as if it were jump jets. Our code leaves out the
   +1 a jump earns. Shown as `provisional`.
7. **A Superheavy with CASE in the center torso, legs or head.** IO:AE p.188 treats it as a Clan 'Mech there, and a
   Clan 'Mech still pays for those locations. Our code subtracts nothing in any Superheavy location with CASE.
8. **Heat of the signature systems.** No rule. The code comment says it follows MegaMek, SSW and the MUL. Shown as
   `provisional`.
9. **Radical heat sinks.** IO:AE p.185's text (x 1.4) disagrees with its own example and with the table on p.190
   (heat sinks x 0.4). We follow the table. Shown as `provisional`; a question for Catalyst.
10. **The Phoenix Hawk LAM example** (IO:AE p.186): the extract's columns run together and the printed arithmetic
    does not add up as extracted (a weapon rating of 271 x 3.00 is not 651). Read the page image before using it as
    a test.
11. **Dead branches.** `_calcBattleValue` carries camouflage, prototype, standard and improved stealth and mimetic
    cases that are always false for a 'Mech. They are the battle armor rows of the TM p.316 table. Drop them when
    converting; no number changes.
12. **Streak heat.** TM p.303 halves the heat of Streak SRMs. Our code halves every weapon flagged Streak (Streak
    LRMs too). Check TO:AUE's rule for Streak LRMs before changing anything.
13. **Stale note.** The Drone Operating System record's notes say its BV rule is not modelled. It is.
14. **"Greater than" against "at least".** TM p.304 starts the heat steps when total weapon heat is greater than the
    efficiency; our code starts them when it is equal too. The result is the same: at equality the last weapon is
    the one that reaches the limit and still counts in full.
15. **BV1: CASE and ammunition in an arm (was "Finding A").** The BMR errata p.12 rewrites the arm line: arm
    ammunition is excused only by CASE in the next location inward. BMR(R) p.153 accepts CASE in the arm or the next
    location inward. Our code applies the BMR(R) rule under both editions. Owner ruling 2026-11-10: fix it per
    edition, in BV1 and in the designer's ammunition and CASE check. FIXED 2026-11-11: under master-rules only CASE
    inward excuses an arm (`armCaseInwardOnly` in `BV_RULES`); the step is now `cited`. The designer needed no change:
    both books allow Inner Sphere CASE only in a torso (BMR p.128, BMR(R) p.136) and the designer already refuses an
    arm under every edition, so the difference shows only on a design that arrives with CASE in an arm (an import).
    Clan CASE covers every location, so a Clan or Mixed design is not affected.
16. **BV1: Inner Sphere Grenade Launcher (was "Finding B").** Maximum Tech, Revised p.90 prints BV 1 (page image).
    Our Level 3 table has 4, which matches no page read. Owner ruling 2026-11-10: each Maximum Tech printing gives
    its values to the edition it belongs to; the FASA printing, if held, gives master-rules its own Level 3 table.
    FIXED 2026-11-11. The library holds the FASA corrected second printing (1999). Its pp.90-92 print the same
    tables and rules as the Revised: Grenade Launcher 1 in both the Inner Sphere and the Clan table. The value is
    now 1 under both editions, and master-rules reads its own Level 3 table (`MAX_TECH_FASA`, the same figures,
    cited to the FASA printing). Effect: a design with Level 3 gear now has the same BV1 under master-rules as
    under master-rules-revised, where before master-rules ignored Level 3. The owner recalls a printing with 15:
    it is neither printing held. A first printing (FASA, 1997) is not in the library: see "Sources to ask the
    owner for".
17. **BV1: the Clan XL engine.** Neither Master Rules book names the Clan XL in the rules text (only "XL engine",
    x 0.75). Both print the Goshawk example with 91 x 1.125. Our code follows the example. Shown as `provisional`.
18. **Stale comment.** `_calcBattleValue1` says the movement modifiers are on BMR(R) p.25. The Attack Modifiers
    Table is on p.33 (BMR p.32). Correct the comment when the function is converted (Task 5).
