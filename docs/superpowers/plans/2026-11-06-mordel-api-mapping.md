# mordel.net API: Scott's 2026-11-05 update mapped against our wish list

Wish list: `2026-11-01-mordel-data-pipeline.md` (ticket #2611-001). Scott's update: "Mordel.Net API update for
testers" (2026-11-05). Where his model differs from the wish list, his model wins.

Tested on the sandbox 2026-11-06 with the documented example units, read-only, 1 s between requests. Raw
responses (no key in them) were saved as sample fixtures for the sync client.

## 1. What his update covers

| Wish list item | Status after this update | Our side |
|---|---|---|
| §1.5 stable ids | Done: `id` per unit, sandbox = live (checked 2026-11-04) | Key on `unit_type_short` + `id` |
| §1.6 change feed | `updated_since` (inclusive). Units never edited have `updated: null`, and `updated_since` still returns them by `created` (checked: bm 98087). No deletions feed. | One `updated_since` query per sync; weekly full list diff for removals |
| §1.7 data plus exports | JSON detail is here. Exports (record sheet, AS card, MegaMek) are "coming next" as files | Wait for files |
| §1.8 provenance | `canon` (true = designer "Catalyst Game Labs"), `sources` (title, publisher, year; no page), `created`/`updated`. No code release marker | Use `canon` instead of the designer test |
| §2.1 types | `bm`, `cv`, `im`, `pm` only | Others never come from mordel |
| §2.1 identity | `name_parts` (name, alternate_name, model), `mul_id`, `omni`, `omni_base_id`, `omni_variants` | Use `name_parts`; drop our `[BASE]` name parsing |
| §2.1 status | `canon`, `designer` (display name only, no member id), `created`, `updated`. No approved flag, no public flag (only public units are served) | Credit by display name |
| §2.1 rules | `tech_base`, `mixed_tech`, `era`, `year`, `rules_level` (word) + `extinct`. No designer's own level, no edition built under | Map levels as decided; drop `extinct`; grade by equipment |
| §2.1 construction | `configuration`, `engine`, `heat_sinks`, `structure`, `armor` (+ points), `gyro`, `cockpit`, `myomer`, `jump_jets`, `targeting`, `fire_control`, turrets, `locations` (armor, rear, structure, patchwork types), `equipment` by item `id` per location with slots, facing, links, flags, stacks | Map each to our classes. Equipment `id` is an instance id; matching to our catalog is by `name` + `technology` (see §3) |
| §2.1 values | `battle_value`, `point_value`, `cost`. No member rating | Compare with ours |
| §2.1 Alpha Strike | `type`, `size`, `move` (text, e.g. `12"j`), `tmm`, `armor`, `structure`, `damage` S/M/L (text, `0*` minimal), `overheat`, `point_value`, `specials`. No E range, no threshold, no role here (role is a top-level field) | Parse move and damage text |
| §2.1 quirks | Not coming (he has none) | None |
| §2.1 availability | Not in the update | None |
| §2.1 text | `fluff` (overview, capabilities, deployment, variants, notables) | Import as readout text, credited |
| §2.1 reviews | Not in the update (low priority anyway) | None |
| §2.1 bulk archive | Not offered | Capped detail batches per run |
| §2.2 equipment database | Not yet | Match by name |
| §2.3 quirks database | Not coming | None |
| §2.4 forum | Out (Scott, 2026-11-02) | None |
| §2.5 downloads, §2.6 products | Not yet | None |
| §3 errors | JSON `{"status":"Error","message":...}` with 400/401/404/405/503 | Handle each; 401 stops the run |
| §3 ETag / Last-Modified | Not sent; `Cache-Control: no-store` only (fixed as he said) | Use `updated` instead |
| §3 API key | `X-API-Key` header only; a key in the URL is refused | As is |
| §3 versioned paths | `/api/v1/` | As is |
| Pictures | `image_url` with `?v=` cache buster, no key, needs a real User-Agent | Fetch only when `?v=` changes |

## 2. What we checked on the sandbox (2026-11-06)

All as documented:

- `/units?limit=3`: the 21 fields in the stated order, `canon` and `omni` present.
- `/units/{type}/{id}` for bm 474, 2303, 123, 5280, 75003, cv 1, 2993, 4774, 4411, pm 14: list fields first in the
  same order, then every detail field in the stated order, none missing, none extra. Every equipment entry has
  exactly the 17 stated fields.
- Location armor adds up to `armor.points` on all 12 units fetched.
- Wasp WSP-3L (bm 474): no Endo Steel or Stealth entries in `equipment`; `structure.type` and `armor.type` name them.
- Goliath (bm 123): `LFL RFL LRL RRL`, no arms. Pwwka LAM (bm 5280): biped codes, `configuration` "Land-Air (Standard)".
- Gold Knight (bm 75003): the PPC Capacitor's `associated_id` is 90, the ER PPC entry's `id`.
- Schiltron PRIME (cv 2993): `omni_turret_tons` {turret 2}. Atlatl II (cv 4774): `Dual`, FT/RT locations.
  TNK-420 (cv 4411): `artemis` "IV-P". Ferret (cv 1): rotor `RO`.
- Errors: unknown id, leading zero and upper-case type give 404 "Unit not found"; a query parameter gives 400 with
  his message; no key gives 401; POST gives 405. Every response sends only `Cache-Control: no-store`.

Not as documented (for Scott):

1. **Hammer HMR-5M (bm 98087)** still shows `cost: 0` and `armor.tons: 0` (105 points, Impact-Resistant) in both
   `/units` and `/units/bm/98087`. The update says 7.5 tons and 5,167,240. Maybe the data fix is on live only.
2. **Sheinhardt Rokett Trukk (cv 5001)** still starts with a non-breaking space in `name` and `name_parts.name`.
3. A trailing slash (`/units/bm/474/`) gives 404 "Endpoint not found", not "Unit not found". Still a 404 as the
   update says; only the message differs.
4. An Omni base lists itself as its own base: Fire Falcon [BASE] (bm 2303) has `omni_base_id: 2303`. Fine for us,
   but the update only describes variants, so worth one line in the docs.
5. `updated` is `null` on units never edited, and `updated_since` returns them by `created`. That answers our earlier
   question (no need for `created_since` in a sync); worth one line in the docs.
6. Equipment `id` is a per-unit instance number (Heat Sink is 13 on bm 474 and on bm 123, ER Medium Laser 5 on
   bm 474 and 77 on bm 98087), and it is `null` on slotless items: the Centaur's (pm 14) ProtoMech ammo comes as five
   `LRM 3 (Ammo 1)` entries with `id` and `location` both null. The docs say only that `location` is null.

## 3. Open for our side

- **Equipment matching.** Unit `equipment[].id` is an instance id within the unit, not an equipment database id,
  so grading rules levels by equipment (wish list §4) means matching `name` + `technology` to our catalogs. Until
  his equipment database exists, unmatched names go to a review list, not a guess.
- **Load on his server.** A full detail pull is about 56,000 requests. The sync client takes the list in 57 pages,
  then details only for new or changed units, capped per run (like `mul:sync`), with a pause between requests.
  Ask Scott what pace he wants for the first full pull.
- **Where the copy lives.** The battletech-tools repo is public. Member designs should not be committed there
  until the user and Scott agree; the mirror stays git-ignored until then.

## 4. Reply to Scott (approved and sent by the user, 2026-11-06)

This final text replaces the first draft. Changes from the draft: the three mismatches are put down to a sandbox not
yet updated (to recheck after his next update), the pacing question is dropped, and the per-user key idea is added.

Follow-ups: recheck the three mismatches after Scott's next sandbox update. His answer on per-user keys and CORS
decides option (c) in the storage decision memo (tools handoff, step 2).

## 5. Scott's answer and our second reply (2026-11-06, evening)

Scott's answer, in short:

- The Hammer (bm 98087) and Sheinhardt (cv 5001) are fixed in production, with code to stop designs getting into
  that state. The sandbox shows the fix only after he copies production to it again. The rewrite rules are being
  changed to accept a trailing slash.
- When the docs are complete, our agent can walk through them for gaps.
- He agrees with per-user keys: pulling the list is cheaper, and users pull stats with their own accounts. His
  agent says CORS is safe and easy if the key stays in the browser. He asked: do users need accounts on his site
  (the key links the two)? Is the key entered once and stored in the browser? Should private units, such as the
  user's own, come in too? Should the list carry more data?

Measured for the reply (sample of every 50th of the 40,047 details pulled by 21:15): a unit detail averages
9.4 KB (1.6 KB gzipped). All 56,043 come to about 530 MB raw, 87 MB gzipped each. The list fields alone are about
440 bytes per unit: about 25 MB raw, about 3.5 MB as one gzipped file.

>   and https://ngcfells.github.io (my test copy). Allowing those three origins is enough, or "*" works too, since
>   the key travels in a header and not a cookie.

>   needs to succeed without a key and allow the X-API-Key header and GET. An Access-Control-Max-Age header would
>   save a lot of those extra requests.
> - If it's easy, the same header on the unit images would let the app draw them onto printed record sheets.

>
> The one gap is removals. updated_since can't tell us when a unit is deleted or made private. Something like a

## 6. Archived fan designs (separate thread, 2026-11-06)

The user asked Scott whether to post old fan designs found through archive.org under an archivist account, crediting
the original creators. Scott had no problem with it but worried about forum clutter, and asked whether building
them as real designs in the designer would preserve them better.

Follow-ups (both threads):

- Recheck the Hammer, the Sheinhardt and the trailing slash after Scott's next production-to-sandbox copy.
- Per-user keys are agreed in principle, so option (c) is the lead in the storage memo. Waiting on: CORS (three
  origins, preflight without a key, Max-Age, images, 429), a "my units" list with private units (the user will make
  test private units once it exists), the list additions (name_parts, mul_id, role) and a removals feed.
- Archive designs: waiting on his answers on an original-designer field, moving designs to their creators, import
  of .mtf/SSW/HeavyMetal files, and a push API (that would need our units mapped back to his format).
- The user is away at a conference in Utah the week of 2026-11-09 and may be fully offline.
