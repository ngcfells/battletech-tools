# Compact 'Mechs Implementation Plan (#172)

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan. The owner's
> execution method is **one chunk per session**, each ending with a commit, a ledger entry and a handoff, and the
> session is cleared before the next chunk. Do not run two chunks in one session. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax.

> **Owner rulings, 2026-11-13 (all six questions answered; see "Owner rulings").** Flint's article is #172. Walkers
> are a unit type of their own, planned in `2026-11-13-future-wars-walkers.md`. The two printings are editions. Any
> equipment that makes sense is allowed. Everything else in the fanzine, and the HMP designs, come in by
> `2026-11-13-best-of-future-wars.md`.

**Goal:** Clell Flint's alternate construction rules can be chosen as a Special Ruleset under the Custom Homebrew
rules level. A 'Mech built under it gets critical slots, a head, a cockpit, an engine and a gyro sized by its weight
class. Its record sheet and play mode use those slot counts. The rest of the fanzine comes in through its own plan.

**Architecture:** Flint's rules change how every 'Mech is built, not one item or unit type, so they are a **Special
Ruleset** (#324, `src/data/special-rulesets.ts`: "optional and homebrew rules that change how the game plays or how
units are built"). It is the first real one; the only ruleset there now is a sample. `BattleMech` reads it through
`getRulesets()`. The first chunk stops `BattleMech` assuming that every location has 6 or 12 slots. That assumption
is written out in at least 21 places. The change must alter nothing, and the bundle tests prove it. Flint's walkers
(four-legged 'Mechs with ten locations) do not fit the canon quad's eight locations, so they are a unit type of their
own with a plan of their own.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, React, Vitest. No new dependencies.

**Spec:** issue #172, and the source below. This plan is Chunk 5 of
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-12-custom-homebrew-batch.md`; that plan's Global Constraints apply here too.

**Source:** *The Best of Future Wars, Volume One* (1991, Herb Barents, ed.; Steve Burnett and Paul Pelfrey
compiled it): Clell Flint, "Alternate Rules for Building Mechs in BattleTech", printed pp.35-38. The PDF is
`JBTIICRework/magazines/Future Wars/Future Wars Magazine - Best of - Future Wars Magazine.pdf`, a scan with no text
layer. **Page mapping:** printed page = PDF page - 1 up to printed p.35 (PDF 36). PDF pages 37-44 are an unnumbered
art insert. After it, printed page = PDF page - 9 (printed p.36 = PDF 45). The OCR text is
`ResourceLibrary/text/Future-Wars-Magazine-Best-of-Future-Wars-Magazine.ocr.txt`. Its PDF 39-44 is noise, and its
p.36 engine table is good. **Read every table from the page image** (`pdftoppm -r 110 -gray -png -f N -l N`): the
OCR drops the turret and the walker slot tables.

The article first appeared in *Future Wars* #11 (`ResourceLibrary/text/future-wars-11-Qyhm8x.ocr.txt`, from line
about 1413; PDF `future_wars_11_Qyhm8x.pdf`). The two printings differ in places (see Printings). The rules summary
and every call made while planning are in the batch ledger, entry "Chunk 5". Read it before Chunk A.

## Owner rulings (2026-11-13)

1. **Flint's article is what #172 calls "Compact 'Mechs".** The words appear in no held *Future Wars* text; the
   owner confirmed the identification.
2. **Walkers: a unit type of their own, planned now:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-13-future-wars-walkers.md`.
3. **Both printings, as editions.** For the biped rules this plan builds, the two printings print the same tables
   (checked on both page images, 2026-11-13: *Future Wars* #11 p.24 and Best-of pp.35-36). They differ only in the
   walker section (see Printings and the walker plan). So the edition shows as **two Special Rulesets with the same
   rules and different credits**, `future-wars-11-construction` and `best-of-future-wars-construction`, which both
   declare `changes: ["mechConstruction"]` and so cannot both be ticked (the existing conflict rule in
   `game-settings.ts`). The Best-of one is listed first.
4. **Any equipment that makes sense.** The tables apply to every engine's center-torso slots and to every gyro (one
   slot a ton). An XL or Light engine's side-torso slots are unchanged. Items keep their own slot counts. Small,
   torso-mounted and drone cockpits are not offered under the ruleset: its cockpit rule replaces the cockpit choice.
   An item that cannot fit a location at its class (a 7-slot item in a light arm) is refused there with a message.
5. **The rest of the fanzine: all of it.** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-13-best-of-future-wars.md`.
6. **The HMP designs too.** Same plan: entered from the stat blocks of *Future Wars* #32 and #33.

## Global Constraints

- Both rulesets are Custom Homebrew (`minRulesLevel` at that level). Their `source`: "Clell Flint, 'Alternate Rules for
  Building Mechs in BattleTech', *The Best of Future Wars, Volume One* (1991), pp.35-36" and "Clell Flint,
  'Alternative Rules for Building Mechs in BattleTech', *Future Wars* #11, p.24". The sheet and TRO credit them
  through `getRulesetCredits`.
- Without the ruleset, nothing changes: every bundle test passes unchanged at every chunk. If one fails, stop for the owner.
- Read the page image before typing a number. A rule the article does not give is ours, labelled as ours in the
  code comment, the ruleset description and the ledger.
- Flint gives no Battle Value or cost. **Our call:** both come from the edition's rules applied to the design as
  built (head structure, cockpit weight and slot counts are what change), with a breakdown note "built under
  Clell Flint's alternate construction rules (Future Wars); Battle Value and cost by <edition> on the design as
  built". No new BV step.
- Failing test first. `npx vitest run --project unit src/classes src/data src/utils`, then `npm run check`.
- Commit and push `beta` (from a cloud session, the session branch). Ask the owner before any deploy, `master`
  fast-forward or news entry.

## Session protocol (every chunk)

As in the batch plan: read the handoff, this plan and the ledger; do the first chunk not marked done; test, commit,
push; append to the ledger what was built and every call that was ours; rewrite the top block of the handoff; stop.

## Models

| Chunk | Work | Model |
|---|---|---|
| A | Slot counts read from one place in `BattleMech`; nothing changes | Opus 5.5 |
| B | The ruleset: slots, head, cockpit, engine and gyro by weight class | Opus 5.5 |
| C | Creator: the ruleset's choices, issues when it is ticked or unticked | Sonnet 5.5 |
| D | Record sheet and play mode: critical tables of any length | Sonnet 5.5 |
| E | Verify and report | Sonnet 5.5 |

Walkers and the rest of the fanzine have their own plans (owner rulings 2 and 5). The walker plan's Chunk A needs
this plan's Chunk B first.

## Rules (Best-of, printed pp.35-37; confirm each against the page image)

| Rule | Light (to 35 t) | Medium (40-55) | Heavy (60-75) | Assault (80-100) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Head slots | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| Each arm | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |
| Each leg | 7 | 10 | 12 | 16 |
| Left / right torso | 7 | 10 | 12 | 16 |
| Center torso | 11 | 14 | 18 | 20 |
| Head structure | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| Cockpit | 2 t, 1 slot | 3 t, 1 slot | 3 t, 1 slot ("most"), or 4 t, 2 slots ("a few") | 4 t, 2 slots |
| Life support | 1 slot | 1 slot | 1 or 2 (with the cockpit) | 2 slots |

- Head armor at most **2 x** head structure (light 6 ... assault 12), not 3 x.
- Sensors: 2 head slots on every 'Mech. Extra sensors: +1 slot, +0.5 t. Extra life support: +1 slot, +0.5 t. The
  cockpit's weight includes its own life support.
- Engine, centre-torso slots by engine weight: 0.5-4.0 t: 4; 4.5-6.0: 5; 6.5-9.0: 6; 9.5-12.0: 7; 12.5-16.0: 8;
  16.5-30.0: 9; 30.5 and up: 10.
- Gyro: one slot per ton of gyro.
- **Ours (no text):** the order of fixed items in each location (head: life support, sensors, cockpit, then the
  rest; arm and leg actuators first, as now); how a critical hit picks a slot in a location that is not 6 or 12
  long (Chunk D); BV and cost (above); which 'Mech types the ruleset allows (biped only; quads, tripods, LAMs,
  QuadVees and superheavies are refused with a message, since Flint's four-legged rules are his walkers).

## Printings (the walker section only)

| Point | *Future Wars* #11 | Best-of (1991) |
|---|---|---|
| Section title | "Rules for Building 4 Legged Mechs" | "Optional Rules for Building Walkers" |
| Centre-torso anti-infantry weapons, base to-hit | "0" | "8" |
| Immobilized walker with every leg standing | cannot be knocked over except by a push, until a leg's structure is gone | not printed |
| Firing arcs | six, named clockwise | "on the attached firing arc sheet" (no sheet in the reprint) |

Read on the #11 page image (2026-11-13): its typewriter face prints zero as a slashed "Ø", so the to-hit is 0.
The variant walker slot table agrees with the Best-of except the assault control section: 16 in #11, 14 in the
Best-of. The walker plan carries all four rows as edition rules.

## Review Focus

- A design saved under the ruleset, opened with the ruleset gone from the registry: it must open with a message
  and its slots must not be silently cut to 6/12. If items no longer fit, report them as issues.
- Ticking the ruleset on an existing 'Mech: every item that no longer fits is listed and nothing is deleted.
- A 35-ton and a 40-ton 'Mech either side of a class line. A tonnage change across a class line is a re-check.
- Head armor over 2 x structure after a class change.
- An engine whose weight sits exactly on a table boundary (4.0 / 4.5 t; 30.0 / 30.5 t).
- The record sheet with a 20-slot centre torso and a 5-slot head.

---

## Chunk A: Slot counts from one place (no behaviour change)

**Files:** Modify `src/classes/battlemech.ts`; test in `src/classes/battlemech.test.ts` (or a new
`battlemech-slots.test.ts`).

**Interfaces (produces):** `BattleMech.getLocationSlotCount(location: string): number`: today's counts (head and legs
6, the rest 12, a QuadVee leg 2, as `_moveCritical` and `_calcCriticals` now spell them). It is used everywhere a
6 or 12 is written for a location.

- [ ] **Step 1:** List every site: `grep -n -E 'Array\((6|12|2)\)\.fill|numSlots = (6|12)|maxLegalSlots|slots? ?(=|===|<) ?(6|12)\b' src/classes/battlemech.ts`
  (21 lines on 2026-11-13; include `_calcCriticals` about line 4840 and `_moveCritical` about 10824), and the
  same grep over `src/ui` and `src/utils` (record sheet, criticals page, SSW import) to list where the UI assumes it.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Failing test pinning `getLocationSlotCount` for biped, quad, tripod, LAM and QuadVee locations.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement; replace each site in the class. UI sites are listed in the ledger for Chunks C and D,
  not changed here.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Unit tests (the bundle tests must pass unchanged), `npm run check`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit `refactor: 'Mech slot counts from one method (#172)`, push, ledger, handoff.

## Chunk B: The ruleset

**Files:** Modify `src/data/special-rulesets.ts` (+ test), `src/classes/battlemech.ts`; create
`src/data/future-wars-construction.ts` (the tables) and `src/classes/battlemech-future-wars.test.ts`.

**Interfaces (produces):** ruleset ids `best-of-future-wars-construction` and `future-wars-11-construction` (owner
ruling 3), each `changes: ["mechConstruction"]`, `removesUnitTypes` none, `minRulesLevel` Custom Homebrew. `FUTURE_WARS_WEIGHT_CLASSES`, `getFutureWarsSlots(tons,
location)`, `getFutureWarsEngineSlots(engineTons)`, `getFutureWarsCockpit(tons, large?)`, `FUTURE_WARS_CONSTRUCTION_RULESETS` (the two ids). On `BattleMech`:
`usesFutureWarsConstruction()`, `getFutureWarsLargeCockpit/setFutureWarsLargeCockpit` (heavy only),
`getExtraSensors/setExtraSensors`, `getExtraLifeSupport/setExtraLifeSupport`, all saved in `export`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Read** printed pp.35-37 in the page images. Correct this plan's Rules table and the ledger wherever
  the page says otherwise.
- [ ] **Step 2: Failing tests**, each named for its rule: slot counts per class and location (one test per table
  row); head structure 3/4/5/6 and head armor maximum 6/8/10/12; cockpit 2/3/3-or-4/4 tons and slots; sensors
  2 slots; extra sensors and extra life support +0.5 t and +1 slot each; engine slots at 4.0, 4.5, 30.0 and 30.5
  tons; gyro slots = gyro tons (a 3-ton gyro takes 3); an XL engine keeps its side-torso slots; an item larger than its
  location at the class is refused there; a small cockpit is not offered; ticking both rulesets is refused by the
  conflict rule; a quad is refused under the ruleset with a message; a
  design without the ruleset is unchanged (the bundle tests); ticking the ruleset on a 'Mech that no longer fits
  lists issues and deletes nothing; `exportJSON`/`importJSON` round-trips the new fields; a save naming the
  ruleset when the registry lacks it loads with a message.
- [ ] **Step 3: See them fail.**
- [ ] **Step 4: Implement.** `getLocationSlotCount` reads the ruleset; `_calcCriticals` places head, engine and gyro
  by the tables. Head structure goes through the structure lookup, so BV and the sheet pick it up with no BV change.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Unit tests and `npm run check`.
- [ ] **Step 6:** Commit `Custom Homebrew: Future Wars alternate 'Mech construction ruleset (#172)`, push, ledger,
  handoff.

## Chunk C: Creator

**Files:** `src/ui/pages/classic-battletech/mech-creator/` (the criticals page and the step that holds the cockpit),
`src/ui/components/edition-choice.tsx` only if the ruleset needs a description there; page tests beside them.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Failing tests: the ruleset is offered at Custom Homebrew and not below; under it the criticals page
  shows each location at its class's length; the heavy cockpit choice and the two extras appear only under it.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Implement, fixing the UI sites Chunk A listed. Then run the app: build a 35-ton and a 100-ton
  'Mech under the ruleset by hand.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Unit tests, `npm run check`, commit `Custom Homebrew: Future Wars construction in the 'Mech creator
  (#172)`, push, ledger, handoff.

## Chunk D: Record sheet and play mode

**Our rule (no text for bipeds), to put in the ruleset description:** a location's slots are printed in tables of
six, the last one short if needed. For a hit, roll 1D6 for the table when there is more than one (re-roll a number
with no table), then 1D6 for the slot (re-roll a number with no slot, as for an empty slot). This is the standard
two-table method stretched; Flint gives "two critical tables" only for the walker's centre torso and control
section.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Failing tests: the sheet renders a 5-slot head and a 20-slot centre torso in tables of six with
  die numbers; play mode's critical-hit helper rolls into them; a standard 'Mech's sheet is unchanged (snapshot).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Implement in `src/ui/components/svg/battlemech-svg.tsx` and the roster play critical table
  (`roster/_criticalHitTable.tsx`).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Unit tests, `npm run check`; print both 'Mechs from Chunk C and look at them.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Commit `Custom Homebrew: Future Wars construction on the record sheet and in play (#172)`, push,
  ledger, handoff.

## Chunk E: Verify and report

- [ ] **Step 1:** `npm run check`; confirm no bundled design changed.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Comment on #172 with what is in, and what the walker and fanzine plans still owe. Leave the issue open
  until they are done.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Ask the owner about shipping. No deploy, `master` fast-forward or news entry without the answer.
