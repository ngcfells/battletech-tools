# Bundled MUL designs: a record sheet for every Master Unit List unit we have a file for

Status: approved 2026-10-25 with the user's rulings on source priority and attribution (items 3 and 6).

## Intent

The Classic Roster's Master Unit List search can show a record sheet (View, TRO, Add) only when it finds a design for
the unit. Today that means the user's own saved designs, the 508 bundled Skunk Werks 'Mechs (rules levels 0-2 only),
and the ArtVee samples. Most MUL entries have no sheet. We already hold source files for most of them: 3,358 SSW
files, MegaMek's 4,295 MTF and 6,723 BLK files. The user wants them converted into our own designs, kept as small
as possible, and shipped (user, 2026-10-25).

## What exists (measured 2026-10-25)

| MUL type | Entries | Source on hand | Importer |
|---|---|---|---|
| BattleMech, IndustrialMech | 4,250 | SSW 3,358; MTF 4,295 | SSW yes; MTF no |
| Battle Armor | 1,199 | BLK | yes |
| Combat Vehicle, OmniVehicle | 1,248 | BLK | no |
| Fighter, Aerospace Craft | 1,012 | BLK | Small Craft and DropShips yes; fighters no |
| Support Vehicle | 446 | BLK | yes |
| Infantry | 441 | BLK | no |
| ProtoMech | 86 | BLK | yes |

The SSW survey: all 3,358 files import. 3,173 match the file's own BV. 3,037 match a MUL 'Mech entry, and 2,912 of
those match the MUL's BV. Import costs about 46 ms a design, so a full library can never be parsed at launch.

Our saved-design JSON is about 10 KB a 'Mech (34 MB for the SSW library). Most of that is the crit table, which is
held twice (`allocation` and each equipment item's placement), plus in-play state (armor and structure bubbles,
to-hit blocks, pilot) and UUIDs. The bundled SSW XML today is 2.1 MB for 508 designs and is parsed at every launch.

## Goals

- A View/TRO/Add result for every MUL entry we have a file for that converts with a correct BV.
- A smaller footprint than today, even with about ten times the designs.
- Nothing parsed at launch: designs load when the user searches.
- Converted once, at build time, by a dev script. The app never ships the raw SSW, MTF or BLK files.

## Non-goals

- No new search or sheet UI. The MUL search dialog, its View/TRO/Add buttons and the existing sheets are reused.
- No hand fixes to individual designs. A design that does not convert cleanly is left out and listed in the
  script's report.

## Design

1. **Compact design format, one codec for every unit type.** A design's export with everything a fresh unit of that
   type would export anyway removed: in-play state, UUIDs, timestamps, defaults, and anything rebuilt on load (the
   duplicate crit table, cost, BV, Alpha Strike values). Loading merges it back onto a fresh unit's export and
   imports that through the existing `importJSON`. Expected size: about 1 KB a 'Mech before gzip.
2. **Build script** (`src/bin/`, run by hand like the existing SSW converter). It reads the source folders, imports
   each file with our importers, matches it to a MUL entry by chassis and model (`getMULMatchKeys`), and keeps it
   when our BV equals the MUL's BV, or the file's own BV where the MUL has none. It writes one data file per unit
   type, plus a report of everything left out and why.
3. **Source priority (user ruling 2026-10-25).** SSW first. MegaMekLab files (MTF, BLK) are used only when no SSW
   file exists for the unit. When an SSW file exists but does not convert cleanly, the unit is left out and reported;
   the script does not fall back to the MegaMek file.
4. **Loading.** Each type's file is a separate chunk, fetched the first time the MUL search needs that type. Only
   the design picked for View/TRO/Add is imported.
5. **Replaces `sswMechs.ts`.** The 2.1 MB XML bundle and the import-at-launch loop go away. The Mech Creator's
   bundled-designs list reads the new 'Mech file. This also covers the open performance issue about parsing every
   bundled 'Mech at launch.
6. **Provenance and attribution (user ruling 2026-10-25).** Each design records its source: `ssw`, `megamek`, or
   `verified` (checked by us against its printed TRO). SSW-sourced files carry the SSW notice, as `sswMechs.ts` does
   today. MegaMek-sourced designs carry the MegaMek credit and its CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 notice, on the design and on the
   About page. When a design is verified against its TRO, its source becomes `verified` and the MegaMek credit and
   license notice are removed from it, since the data is then our own transcription. The About page notice goes when
   no `megamek` design is left.

## Rounds (one per round, ship and report after each)

1. Codec, build script and every SSW 'Mech. `sswMechs.ts` is retired, and the corpus tests move to the new file.
2. BLK units with importers we already have: battle armor, ProtoMechs, Support Vehicles, Small Craft and DropShips.
3. MTF import ('Mech MTF issue) and the 'Mechs SSW does not cover.
4. BLK import for combat vehicles, then fighters, then conventional infantry. Each one is its own round, and each
   closes part of the MegaMek BLK issue.

## Tests

- **Round trip:** every bundled design, decoded and imported, gives the same BV, tonnage, cost and crit table as
  the direct import it was made from. This is a corpus test, sharded like `ssw-corpus-*.test.ts`.
- **Search:** a unit from each new file appears in the MUL search with View working (component test, per type).
- **Size:** each data file's size is pinned, so a growing file is a deliberate change.

## Left to the builder

The exact field list the codec drops, the data file paths and names, and the report format.

## Builder's calls (round 1, 2026-10-25)

- **Codec** (`src/utils/bundled-designs.ts`): the unit's export without in-play state, minus every top-level field
  equal to a blank unit's, minus BV, cost, Alpha Strike value, UUID and timestamp, minus empty fields inside list
  entries, with UUIDs shortened to `#n`. A 'Mech's crit table entry for an installed item keeps only its place
  (uuid, location, slot, rear, size, and crits where a split item's differ). Heat sinks and other entries with no
  equipment item keep every field: dropping them lost crit table entries. About 2.9 KB a 'Mech before gzip, not the
  1 KB first guessed.
- **Files**: `src/data/bundled/mechs-index.json` (one header a line: name, model, tons, BV, cost, rules level, year,
  tech, MUL id, source) and `src/data/bundled/mechs/<n>.json`, 150 designs a chunk, each fetched on first use. The
  report is `src/data/bundled/mechs-report.md`.
- **Build**: an env-gated vitest writer (`WRITE_BUNDLED_MECHS=1`), like the ArtVee MUL writer, since it needs Vite's
  module resolution. It also runs the old corpus checks (engine, gyro and structure names, failed crit placements,
  import errors), which leave a file out instead of failing a test.
- **OmniMechs** are left out in round 1: the SSW import reads only the base loadout, not the configurations, so every
  OmniMech fails its BV check. The SSW OmniMech issue (#112) brings them in; the header and index already carry
  configurations for when it does.
- **Tests**: the build checks every design's round trip in full (BV, cost, tonnage, crit table). The standing test
  loads every 10th design and compares BV, cost and tonnage with its header, since a full load is about 140 ms a
  design. Loading is that slow because each setter in `import` runs a full recalculation.
- **Retired with `sswMechs.ts`**: the old converter (`src/bin/convert-ssw-to-bttools.ts`), the SSW corpus shards, and
  the developer-menu SSW Sanity Check page, whose BV and cost comparison the build report now does for every file.
