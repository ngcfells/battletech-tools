# Beta feedback: era-first builders, ammo, tonnage, sponsons, vehicle sheet

Date: 2026-10-21. Status: approved by the user in chat 2026-10-21 (all four recommended options).

## Why

The user built a Thumper ArtVee on the beta site and reported seven problems. Each item below is one task with its
own tests and commit, in this order.

## Items

1. **Era first, and the era gates the tech base.** The Clan tech base is not selectable in the Star League era (user
   ruling; it replaces the 2026-09-30 decision in commit 92cc23ba). In every builder the era select comes right after
   the rules edition and rules level selects, lists every era the unit type can use, and the tech base select offers
   only the bases that era allows (intersected with what the rules edition allows). Picking an era the current base
   cannot use switches the base: Mixed Clan to Clan, Mixed IS to IS, Clan to IS, IS to Clan. A loaded design keeps its
   tech base; its era moves to the nearest open one (the classes' existing `setEra` behaviour).
   - `star-league` becomes IS only. Clan and Mixed start at `clan-founding-years` / `clan-inv` as now.
2. **Ammunition sort keys.** One format for every ammo record: `ammo, <weapon>, <munition>[, <side>]`, weapon names
   spelled the same in every record of that weapon (e.g. `long tom`, never `long-tom` or `long tom artillery`;
   `artillery` is not a separate leading word). A test pins the format and that every record of one weapon shares
   its `ammo, <weapon>` prefix.
3. **Ammunition list shows only ammo for mounted weapons**, with a "Show all ammunition" checkbox (off by default)
   in each builder's equipment list. Matching uses `getCompatibleAmmo`.
4. **Tonnage bar.** Every builder's equipment pages show a bar that stays on screen: tons used / total and remaining,
   and slots (or critical spaces) used / total where the unit has them; red when over.
5. **Sponsons are placement locations.** With sponson turrets, Left Sponson and Right Sponson are placement choices
   beside Left and Right; the designer decides which side weapons go in them. Sponson weight is 5% of each sponson's
   weapons, rounded up to the half ton, and both sponsons must carry the same weapon tonnage (TO p.348 and the turret
   construction rule: "an alternative to standard side-mounted weapons", weight from the weapons "assigned to" the
   turret). Critical hits treat sponson weapons as side weapons (TO p.348). Old saves: side weapons on a sponson
   vehicle load into the sponsons, as they were treated before.
6. **Vehicle ammunition prints its location.** Combat Vehicle ammunition goes in the Body (TM Step 5: only
   non-weapon items such as ammunition and sensors may be placed there; page to be confirmed from the PDF). The
   record sheet's ammo lines print "BD".
7. **Vehicle armor diagram.** Centred horizontally; a top-down outline per motive type (tracked hull with treads,
   wheeled, hover with skirt, VTOL with rotor, naval hull, WiGE, and the rest falling back to the nearest), with
   the turret when there is one; armor and structure circles larger than now.

8. **Readable warning text.** (Added by the user mid-pass, 2026-10-21.) The red warning and error text across the
   app is too small to read. No text smaller than 0.75rem anywhere; warning text at least 0.875rem, keeping
   WCAG 2.1 AA contrast (4.5:1) for the red against its background.

## Non-goals

- No change to which equipment a tech base may mount, beyond the Star League ruling.
- No change to Battle Value or cost rules.

## Claude's calls

- Era-switch fallback order for the tech base (item 1).
- Sort key format details (item 2).
- The tonnage bar's look and where it sticks (item 4).
- Old sponson saves load with side weapons in the sponsons (item 5).
